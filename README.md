# iOS Networking

![Platform iOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/nanodegree-iOS-blue.svg)

This repository contains resources for Udacity's iOS Networking with Swift course.

## Overview

iOS Networking teaches foundational principles of networking and how they are applied in an iOS-context. The course uses a series of example applications and playgrounds as demonstrations:

- Prereqs (associated values, errors, generics, guards)
- URLPlayground
- ImageRequest
- Randog
- HouseJSON
- JSONParsingExercises
- TheMovieManager

Each application has a "complete" version which is already fully-implemented.

## Setup

Generally speaking, most projects can run without any additional setup. However, consult the iOS Networking with Swift course for more information.
